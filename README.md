## 📁 Task 1: Visualize Activation Maps

📝 *Description*  
This task visualizes *activation maps* from a CNN model to highlight which regions of an image trigger the filters during emotion detection.

✨ *Key Features:*
- 🧠 Uses a pre-trained CNN model  
- 🔍 Helps in understanding model interpretability  
- ❌ No GUI required

## 📁 Task 2: Nationality Detection Model

📝 *Description*  
A machine learning model that predicts a person's *nationality* from an image, and based on the result, predicts additional attributes.

🌍 *Predictions Based On Nationality:*
- 🇮🇳 *Indian*: Age, Dress Color, Emotion  
- 🇺🇸 *USA*: Age, Emotion  
- 🌍 *African*: Emotion, Dress Color  
- 🌐 *Others*: Nationality and Emotion only  

✨ *Key Features:*
- 🖼 Image upload support  
- 🧾 GUI with preview of input images and output results

## 📁 Task 3: Emotion Detection through Voice

📝 *Description*  
A voice-based emotion detection model designed to detect emotions *only from female voices* using audio recordings or uploads.

🎯 *Key Features:*
- 🔊 Detects emotions from voice notes  
- 🚺 Works exclusively with female voices  
- ⚠ Prompts the user if a non-female voice is uploaded
